It details several courses including:\n\n* **Theory Courses:** Data Structures I (BTCS209T), Database Management Systems (BTCS203T), Mathematics for Engineers (BTCS211T), Computer Networks (BTCS207T), a Department Specific Elective (BTCSDxxxT), Tinkering, Innovation & Entrepreneurship (UAC028T), and a Career Advancement Module (UVCxxxT).  These are assessed through attendance (ATT), continuous written assessment (CWA)/practical work assessment (PWA), mid-term exams (MTE), assignments/viva, and end-semester exams (ESE).\n\n* **Practical Courses:** Data Structures I Lab (BTCS209P), Database Management Systems Lab (BTCS203P), Problem Solving Using Data Structure and DBMS and Analytical Skills and Professional Communication (SECS03), Project III (BTCS003P), and Internship Evaluation I (BTCS003I).  These are assessed similarly to theory courses, but with a different weighting for practicals.\n\n* **Departmental Specific Electives:**  Including Fundamentals of Data Analytics (BTCSD203T).\n\nEach course includes a detailed syllabus with learning objectives, course outcomes mapped to program outcomes, and suggested reading materials.  The syllabi cover topics such as data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, hashing), database management (SQL, normalization, transaction management),  mathematics (linear algebra, probability, statistics), computer networks (protocols, routing, security), data analytics (data collection, cleaning, visualization, statistical methods, predictive modeling), tinkering and entrepreneurship, and competitive coding.  Skill Enhancement Courses (SEC) are evaluated separately by the T&P cell.\n\n\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Image Summary:\n[Quota Error]: \ud83d\udeab All Gemini API keys exhausted.
